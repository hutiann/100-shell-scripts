%C - SMBus communication driver for ACPI Embedded Controller (EC).

    Sony VPCW22Z1R doesn't provide ACPI tables for Embedded Controller and
SMBus devices. By default driver assumes EC_SC register address 0x66 and
EC_DATA register address 0x62. Sony VPCW22Z1R has SMBus host controller at
offset 0x18 of Embedded Controller, which is also not listed in ACPI tables.
