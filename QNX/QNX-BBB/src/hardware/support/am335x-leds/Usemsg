%C - LEDs driver for Beaglebone board

%C 

No options. The driver can be used using the 'write' function, by writing
a string that holds the leds value. For example:

    fh = open("/dev/leds", 0);
    write(fh, "1", 1);       // sets leds to binary 0001
    write(fh, "7", 1);       // sets leds to binary 0111

Hexadecimal can be used as well:

    write(fh, "0xF", 3);     // sets leds to binary 1111

The driver can also be used in scripts and in a terminal window:

    echo 1 > /dev/leds       // sets leds to binary 0001
    echo 7 > /dev/leds       // sets leds to binary 0111
    echo 0xF > /dev/leds     // sets leds to binary 1111
