%C	- logs events into an event file - default
	event file is /dev/shmem/tracebuffer.kev.

Options:
	-n <num> number of iterations to be logged in iterations mode
		( default is 32, 0 for unlimited )
	-k <num> number of buffers allocated in the kernel
		( default is 32 of ~16k each )
	-b <num> maximum number of dynamic buffers allocated in tracelogger
